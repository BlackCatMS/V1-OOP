"Hoof, hoof, helloof!" "Watame did nothing wrong!" first coined[sic]

A sheep bard that goes around everywhere. She loves singing and is fluffy! YES! FLUFFY! Being a herbivore, she loves potato chips.

She makes music and videos together with the members of the Tsunomaki Troupe.

Make sure you check out her Tsunomaki Rock Paper Scissors videos as well![5]
Personality

Watame speaks in a pleasant tone befitting her image of a soft fluffy sheep. Her voice has been noted by fans to be especially soft, mature and womanly. However, in direct contrast to this image, Watame often amuses herself by making crazed facial expressions. Her wide-eyed, psychotic smile has become iconic on her channel, even appearing on some of her official merchandise (a double-sided pillow cover). She also bobs and weaves her head and body around, which has become one of her signature gestures that she does especially when singing.

She seems to be okay with her fellow hololive members eating her during collaboration streams, as she reassured her fans that even if she was eaten she would respawn after an 8-second timer.
